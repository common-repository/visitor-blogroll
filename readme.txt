Widget which allows visitors to your blog to leave an RSS feed of their blog.

== Description ==

The visitor blogroll is a Wordpress Plugin/Widget which allows visitors to your blog to leave an RSS feed of their blog which is then displayed on your visitor blogroll. The visitor blogroll looks like the standard blogroll except there is an input box and a submit button which your visitors can use to submit their own blogs which are then displayed in the visitor blogroll. Great for networking and discovering your audience.

Developed by us at the [christmas gifts](http://christmas-gifts.makers-online.co.uk "The Christmas Gifts blog") for a bit of fun and to find out about our readers.
